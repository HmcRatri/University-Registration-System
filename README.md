# University-Registration-System
Introduction 
 The name of my system is University Registration System (URS). Where register maintain information, create course and delete course, Professors must be able to access the online system to indicate which courses they will be teaching, and to see which students signed up for their course offerings and student will see the course catalog, select four courses for next semester.

This system is mainly for university student to do online course registration also for professors and register in a university. This system will have the following features: 
•	View All Course 
•	Select Course 
•	View Course Fee 
•	View All Register Student

•	Create Course 
•	Delete Course

Purpose 
This system will be made to allow you to reap the benefit of a massive cost reduction in your annual enrollment and registration process. No more paper to lose, no more trying to figure out What is the name written in that document. Instead you end up with clear validated data that is ready for your University Registration System. 
In short, you are in control in your process and your way. 
Scope 
University Registration System is a System which will be developed to ensure that you gets the best digital system for university. 
	Student--someone who is registered to take courses at the University. 
	Professor--someone who is licensed to teach at the University. 
	Registrar--someone who is responsible for the maintenance of the Registration System. 
	Classes and schedule systematization. 
	Implement changes easy as one, two, and three.

Vision 
The vision of this system would be used by professors to indicate the courses they will teach, by students to select courses, and by the registrar to complete the registration process by creating courses. 
Why This System Necessary?? 
Now a day’s course registration is currently done by hand. Students fill out forms that contain their course selections and return the forms to the adviser. Adviser then enters the selections into a database and a process is executed to create student schedules. The registration process takes from one to two weeks to complete. For saving time this system is necessary.  
Proposed Solution 
	Online Course Catalog
	 Online Database
	Backup or restore
